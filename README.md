## Biography

Hello! I am a research scientist (NLP/Data) at Samsung Research. Previously, I received Ph.D. in Computer
Science at Yonsei University, <a href="http://icl.yonsei.ac.kr">Internet Computing Lab (ICL)</a>, advised by
Prof. Kyong-Ho Lee. After completing my Ph.D., I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Yonsei University
with the same professor.

My research interest is highly related to <em><b>Human-like Artificial Intelligence</b></em>, including
knowledge representation (e.g., knowledge graph embedding and graph embedding) and knowledge-based
applications (e.g., Knowledge-enhanced NLP Applications, Information Retrieval & Recommendation). I have
covered a wide range of data types (e.g., matrix/tensor, text, graph, time series) for various tasks (e.g.,
classification, prediction, retrieval, data generation).
