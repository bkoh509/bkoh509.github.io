1. Graph Representation Learning
Node & Graph Classification, Link Prediction
Node Classification
Focuses on assigning labels to individual nodes based on graph structure and node features
Commonly applied to tasks like social network user classification, fraud detection, and biological function prediction in protein interaction networks
Techniques include Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and GraphSAGE

Graph Classification
Aims to predict a label for an entire graph (e.g., determining whether a molecular graph is toxic or non-toxic)
Useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and social network analysis
Approaches often combine node-level features and hierarchical pooling methods to learn a global graph representation

Link Prediction
Predicts the existence or likelihood of a connection between two nodes in a graph
Widely used in social networks (friend suggestions), e-commerce (product recommendations), and knowledge graphs (relationship discovery)
Methods incorporate node embeddings, pairwise distance metrics, and relational reasoning

Knowledge Graph Representation/Completion/Validation/Construction
Knowledge Graph Representation
Involves learning vector embeddings for entities and relations to capture semantic and structural information
Key approaches include TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, and RotatE
Useful for downstream tasks like question answering and recommender systems

Knowledge Graph Completion
Aims to predict missing facts (edges) in a knowledge graph
Uses embedding-based models or rule-based inference to discover hidden relationships
Helps ensure knowledge bases remain comprehensive and updated

Knowledge Graph Validation
Ensures that newly added facts are correct and consistent
Combines logical consistency checks with machine learning-based anomaly detection
Crucial for maintaining high-quality, trustworthy knowledge repositories

Knowledge Graph Construction
Builds knowledge graphs from unstructured or semi-structured data sources (e.g., text, tables)
Includes entity recognition, relation extraction, entity linking, and data integration steps
Often requires NLP pipelines, crowdsourcing, and automated curation to scale



2. Recommender Systems
Knowledge-Enhanced & Explainable Recommendations
Knowledge-Enhanced Recommendations
Incorporates external knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs, domain ontologies) to improve recommendation accuracy and coverage
Addresses the “cold start” problem by leveraging information about items, users, or contextual factors
Enables more sophisticated user preference modeling and semantic reasoning

Explainable Recommendations
Provides interpretable reasons for why certain items are recommended
Uses visual dashboards, natural language explanations, or feature attribution methods (e.g., attention, feature importance)
Builds user trust and satisfaction by reducing the “black box” aspect of recommender algorithms


Conversational Recommendation, Graph-based Recommendation
Conversational Recommendation
Interactively gathers user preferences through a dialog interface (text-based chat or voice assistant)
Dynamically refines recommendations based on real-time user feedback
Employs reinforcement learning, multi-turn conversation modeling, and user intent detection

Graph-based Recommendation
Models users, items, and auxiliary information as interconnected nodes to capture rich relational signals
Applies graph neural networks or graph-based similarity measures to generate recommendations
Excels in complex domains, such as social recommendations, e-commerce, and knowledge-driven suggestions



3. Natural Language Processing
Question Answering, Information Retrieval & Extraction
Question Answering (QA)
Automatically finds answers to user queries from structured or unstructured data (e.g., text passages, knowledge graphs)
Spans open-domain QA (searching large corpora) and closed-domain QA (domain-specific knowledge bases)
Techniques include transformer-based language models (e.g., BERT, GPT) and QA-specific architectures (e.g., DrQA, FiD)

Information Retrieval (IR)
Focuses on retrieving relevant documents or passages in response to a query
Key methods range from traditional TF-IDF and BM25 to advanced neural ranking models like ColBERT and DPR
Critical for search engines, QA pipelines, and large-scale text analytics

Information Extraction (IE)
Identifies structured information (entities, relations, events) from unstructured text
Encompasses named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction, event detection, and coreference resolution
Forms the foundation for knowledge graph construction, text analytics, and advanced semantic understanding


Multi-Modal & Knowledge-Enhanced Foundation Models
Multi-Modal Foundation Models
Integrate multiple data modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, video) into a single representation
Enables tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and video summarization
Approaches include CLIP, ALIGN, and various vision-language transformers

Knowledge-Enhanced Foundation Models
Inject external knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs, domain-specific lexicons) into large language models to improve reasoning and factual accuracy
Alleviates hallucinations by grounding model outputs in verified information
Techniques range from knowledge prompting to fine-tuning with entity embeddings or knowledge graph lookups


Knowledge & LLM Distillation
Knowledge Distillation
Transfers knowledge from a large “teacher” model or knowledge source to a smaller “student” model
Reduces model size and inference latency while retaining performance
Key for deploying NLP systems in resource-constrained environments (e.g., mobile devices, edge computing)

LLM Distillation
Adapts large language models (e.g., GPT, BERT) into smaller, task-specific architectures
Preserves the benefits of pre-training while drastically cutting down computational costs
Common techniques include layer skipping, weight quantization, and teacher-student training frameworks



4. Synergizing LLMs and Graphs
Text-to-Graph & Graph-to-Text Generation
Text-to-Graph Generation
Automatically converts textual descriptions or dialogues into structured graph representations (e.g., knowledge graphs or scene graphs)
Useful for summarizing textual content in a structured form for downstream graph analytics
Relies on advanced natural language understanding, entity linking, and relation extraction

Graph-to-Text Generation
Converts graph-based data (e.g., knowledge graph substructures) into coherent text or natural language descriptions
Applicable to personalized reports, chatbots, or question answering explanations grounded in graph data
Requires handling graph traversal, content planning, and natural language generation


Knowledge-Grounded & Context-Aware Response Generation with LLMs
Knowledge-Grounded Response Generation
Utilizes knowledge bases or external corpora to produce accurate, factually grounded responses in chatbots or virtual assistants
Reduces the risk of hallucinations by referencing reliable knowledge sources
Methods include retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge attention mechanisms, and memory-augmented models

Context-Aware Response Generation
Tailors responses to user context, conversation history, and broader discourse
Involves multi-turn dialogue modeling, user preference tracking, and situational awareness
Enhances user experience with coherent, personalized interactions


Graph-Structured Interaction for LLMs (GraphRAG, Graph-driven LLM Agents)
GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Combines graph retrieval mechanisms with large language models to generate factually accurate content
Leverages graph embeddings or structured searches to locate relevant nodes/edges as conditioning for generation
Offers more interpretable and explainable results than purely text-based retrieval

Graph-Driven LLM Agents
Employs graph structures to guide an LLM’s decision-making or action planning in complex tasks
Facilitates step-by-step reasoning, multi-hop inference, and structured knowledge manipulation
Potentially revolutionizes AI agents with enhanced reasoning, planning, and transparency
