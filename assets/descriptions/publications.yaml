  - 유저 선호도를 정교하게 파악하여 향상된 추천을 수행하기 위해, 외부 지식 기반의 추천이 많이 제안되어옴. 본 논문에서는 멀티모달 데이터(지식 그래프와 리뷰 텍스트) 사이의 상관관계를 그래프/텍스트 내 aspect를 고려하여 contrastive pretrining을 수행함. 따라서, 유저의 미세한 aspect-level 선호도 (지식 그래프의 general features와 리뷰 텍스트의 salient features) 기반으로 추천 성능을 향상시킴
  - External knowledge-based recommender systems can provide a better understanding of user preferences and enable improved recommendations. In this paper, we propose a contrastive pretraining to capture the correlations between aspects within multimodal external knowledge, i.e., a knowledge graph and review texts. Thus, we can learn users' fine-grained aspect-level preferences that incorporate both general features of the knowledge graph and salient features of the review text, resulting in recommendation performance improvement.

  - 추천시스템 내 InfoNCE-like loss들은 한 유저당 다수의 negative 아이템을 활용하는 non-symmetric loss로, 유의미한 아이템 분포 학습에 집중함. 본 논문에서는 다수의 negative 유저와 아이템을 동시에 활용하고 각 유저/아이템 분포 특징을 보존하기 위해 stop-gradient를 적용한 symmetric loss를 제안하여, 최적화된 유저/아이템 분포를 동시에 학습할 수 있음. 결과적으로, user/item prediction 성능을 동시에 향상시킴
  - InfoNCE-like losses in recommendation systems are non-symmetric losses that utilize multiple negative items per user and focus on learning meaningful item distributions. In this paper, we propose a symmetric loss that utilizes multiple negative users and items simultaneously and applies a stop-gradient to preserve each characteristic of user/item embedding distributions, so that we can simultaneously explore optimized user/item distributions. As a result, the user and item prediction performances can be improved simultaneously.

"Active learning for cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction":

  - text에서의 N-ary relation 추출은 대량의 레이블링된 고품질 dataset이 필요함. 본 논문에서는 data 의존성이 완화된, multiple sentences로부터 N-ary relation을 추출하는 active learning 기반의 incremental training을 제안함. 이때, 제안하는 schema-aware sampling 기법은 최초 학습된 (relation과 entitiies 사이의) 구조적 유사도 추출 모델을 활용하여, 레이블이 안된 dataset에서 유의미한 샘플을 추가적으로 활용함
  - N-ary relation extraction from text requires a large amount of labeled high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose an active learning-based incremental training method for extracting N-ary relations from multiple sentences that is less data-dependent. The proposed schema-aware sampling technique leverages the initially trained structural similarity extraction model (between relations and entities) to further utilize significant samples from unlabeled datasets.
